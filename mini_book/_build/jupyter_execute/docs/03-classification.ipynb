In particular, the model should learn from California census data and be able to predict wether the median house price in a district (population of 600 to 3000 people) is below or above a certain threshold, given some predictor variables. Hence, we face a **supervised learning** situation and should use a **classification model** to predict the categorical outcomes (below or above the preice). Furthermore, we use the **F1-Score** as a performance measure for our classification problem.\n",
