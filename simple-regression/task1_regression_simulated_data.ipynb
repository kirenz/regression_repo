    "# Task 1: Linear regression with simulated data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this application you will create some simulated data and fit simple linear regression models to it (see Application 2 for code hints). \n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: Make sure to use **np.random.seed(1)** prior to starting part (a) to ensure consistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Create a vector, **X** , containing 100 observations drawn from a N (0, 1) distribution. This represents a feature, X .\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Create a error vector, **err** (error), containing 100 observations drawn from a N(0, 0.25) distribution i.e. a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation 0.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Using X and err, generate a vector **Y** according to the model: **Y = −1 + 0 .5 X + err** (model 1). This is the \"true\" relationship between Y and X, also called a **population model** with known parameters. Questions: what is the length of the vector Y? What are the values of $β_0$ and $β_1$ in this linear (population) model?\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Create a scatterplot displaying the relationship between X and Y. Comment on what you observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Now fit a least squares linear model (this is our model 2) to predict Y using X (which will yield $\\hat{Y}$). Comment on the model obtained (use .summary() and the mean squared error of the residuals). How do $\\hat{β_0}$ and $\\hat{β_1}$ of model 2 compare to $β_0$ and $β_1$ of the (real) population model (i.e. model 1)?\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Display the least squares regression line on the scatterplot obtained in (d) in the color red. Furthermore, draw the population regression line (model 1) on the plot in blue color. Add a legend.\n",
    "\n",
    "(g) Now fit a polynomial regression model that predicts Y using X and $X^2$. Is there evidence that the quadratic term improves the model fit? Explain your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "(h) Repeat (a)–(f) after modifying the data generation process in such a way that there is **less noise** (standard deviation is smaller) in the data. The model 1 should remain the same. You can do this by decreasing the standard deviation of the normal distribution used to generate the **err** (error) term in (b) (use sd = 0.05). Describe your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) What are the confidence intervals for $β_0$ and $β_1$ based on the original data set (used in e) and the less noisy data set (created in h)? Comment on your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "(j) What are the standard errors for $β_0$ and $β_1$ based on the original data set (used in e) and the less noisy data set (created in h)? Comment on your results.\n",
